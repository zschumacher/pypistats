# pypistats

An application I'm working on with [@crflynn](http://github.com/crflynn) to v2 his project, [pypistats.org]() using [fast api](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com).


## Quickstart
To get the app up and running locally...
```bash
make setup
make serve
```

To run it in docker...
```bash
make build
make up
```
